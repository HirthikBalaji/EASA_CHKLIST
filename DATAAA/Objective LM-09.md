**Data Management Checklist**
==================================================

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Have all data management requirements been captured?
	+ [Yes/No]
* Are all data management requirements documented and available for review?
	+ [Yes/No]

### Data Collection

* Has data collection been performed for each individual data point?
	+ [Yes/No]
* Is the collected data relevant to the ML model's objectives?
	+ [Yes/No]

### Data Labelling (only in supervised learning)

* Has data labelling been performed for all training, validation, and test datasets?
	+ [Yes/No]
* Are the labels accurate and consistent across all datasets?
	+ [Yes/No]

### Data Preparation

* Has pre-processing, data transformation, and feature engineering been applied to the data?
	+ [Yes/No]
* Is the prepared data relevant and suitable for the ML model's objectives?
	+ [Yes/No]

### Identification of Data Sets

* Have the various datasets (training, validation, test) been identified and documented?
