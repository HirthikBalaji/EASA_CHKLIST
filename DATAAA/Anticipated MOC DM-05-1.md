Here is the checklist generated for the author developing the artificial intelligence - machine learning software and the reviewer reviewing it:

**Requirements Capture**
======================

### AI/ML Constituent Requirements

* Has the applicant captured all requirements necessary to design and implement the AI/ML constituent?
* Are safety requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent, including:
	+ Performance
	+ Reliability
	+ Resilience
* Are information security requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent?
* Are functional requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent?
* Are operational requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent, including:
	+ ODD monitoring and performance monitoring
	+ Detection of out-of-distribution input data
	+ Data recording requirements
* Are other non-functional requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent, such as:
	+ Scalability
* Have interface requirements been captured?

### AI/ML Constituent ODD

* Has a precise characterization of the AI/ML constituent ODD been performed?
* Have parameters pertaining to the AI/ML constituent ODD been defined and traced to the corresponding parameters in the OD when applicable?

**Data Management**
==================

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Have data management requirements been captured, including:
	+ Safety requirements
	+ Information security requirements
	+ Functional requirements
	+ Operational requirements
* Are derived requirements reviewed from a safety perspective?
* Are failure conditions classified for each requirement validated?

### Data Collection and Preparation

* Has data collection been performed to gather the necessary data sets?
* Is data labelling complete (only in supervised learning)?
* Have data transformation, pre-processing, and feature engineering been performed?
* Are the various data sets used in the learning phase identified (typically training, validation, and test data sets)?
* Have data set verification procedures been implemented, including:
	+ Accuracy
	+ Completeness
	+ Representativeness with respect to ML requirements and AI/ML constituent ODD?

### Data Independence and Bias Elimination

* Are independence requirements between data sets met?
* Has unwanted bias inherent in the data sets been identified and eliminated?
