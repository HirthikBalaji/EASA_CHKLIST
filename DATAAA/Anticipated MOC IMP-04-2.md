Here is the generated checklist for the author developing the artificial intelligence-machine learning software and for the reviewer reviewing it:

**Configuration Items**
======================================================

Author:
* Have you managed all data, training, validation, and test data sets used for the frozen model as configuration items?
* Are all tooling used during the transformation of data also being managed as configuration items?

Reviewer:
* Has the author managed all data, training, validation, and test data sets used for the frozen model as configuration items?
* Have the author's tooling used during the transformation of data been properly managed as configuration items?

**Quality and Process Assurance**
======================================================

Author:
* Are quality and process assurance principles being applied to the development of the AI-based system with the required independence level?
* Have all activities been completed as outlined in plans, or have deviations been addressed?

Reviewer:
* Is the author applying quality and process assurance principles to the development of the AI-based system with the required independence level?
* Are all activities being completed as outlined in plans, or are there any deviations that need to be addressed?

**Reuse of AI/ML Models**
======================================================

Author:
* Have you considered replacing or modifying previously developed AI/ML constituents or ML models?
* Have you adapted OD and/or ODD; ensured data quality; managed change reports; ensured development explainability; and scaled the model for reuse?

Reviewer:
* Has the author considered replacing or modifying previously developed AI/ML constituents or ML models?
* Are there any issues with OD and/or ODD adaptation, data quality, change management, development explainability, and scalability that need to be addressed?

**Proportionality of Guidance**
======================================================

Author:
* Have you applied proportionality principles based on the AI level (per Objective CL-01) and criticality (assurance level per Objective SA-01) of the item containing the ML model?
* Have you considered the limited experience gained from operations on the guidance proposed in this document?

Reviewer:
* Has the author applied proportionality principles based on the AI level and criticality of the item containing the ML model?
* Are there any concerns with proportionality that need to be addressed?
