**Data Quality Requirements Checklist for AI/ML Software Development and Review**

### 3.1.3 Data Collection

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Identify different sources of data relevant to the training | ✅ |
| Collect data in accordance with defined ODD (Operating Data Definition) | ✅ |
| Ensure satisfaction of defined DQRs (Data Quality Requirements) | ✅ |
| Consider personal data and privacy protection when collecting data | ✅ |
| Apply data sampling techniques if necessary (e.g. simple random, clustered, stratified, systematic) | ❌ |

### 3.1.3.2 Data Labelling (Supervised Learning)

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Annotate or label the data set according to specific requirements | ✅ |
| Ensure annotated or labelled data satisfies DQRs captured under Objective DA-04 | ✅ |
| Use manual or automated annotation process | ❌ |
| Consider outsourcing annotation step if necessary (e.g. image annotations) | ❌ |

### Additional Requirements

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Verify data against subset of DQRs at each step of the data management process | ✅ |
| Ensure completeness and representativeness of sampling (if applied) | ✅ |
| Consider using data augmentation techniques or synthetic data to address lack of data completeness or representativeness | ❌ |
