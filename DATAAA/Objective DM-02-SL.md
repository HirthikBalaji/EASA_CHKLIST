Here is the generated checklist in Markdown format:

**IDENTITY AND PURPOSE**

* Has a preliminary AI/ML constituent architecture been described to serve as reference for related safety assessment and learning assurance objectives? [YES/NO]
* Have all derived requirements been provided to the (sub)system processes, including the safety assessment? [YES/NO]
* Has evidence of validation of the derived requirements been documented? [YES/NO]
* Has evidence of determination of any impact on the safety assessment and (sub)system requirements been documented? [YES/NO]
* Have all captured (sub)system requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent been verified? [YES/NO]

**DATA MANAGEMENT**

* Are data sources identified and collected in accordance with the defined ODD, ensuring satisfaction of the defined DQRs? [YES/NO]
* Does the annotated or labelled data in the data set satisfy the DQRs captured under Objective DA-04? [YES/NO]
* Have pre-processing operations been defined to properly address the captured requirements (including DQRs)? [YES/NO]
* Have transformations been defined and documented to convert the pre-processed data from the specified input space into features effective for the performance of the selected learning algorithm? [YES/NO]
* Are the data distributed into three separate data sets meeting the specified DQRs in terms of independence (as per Objective DA-04)? [YES/NO]
	+ Training data set and validation data set used during model training
	+ Test data set used during learning process verification and inference model verification
