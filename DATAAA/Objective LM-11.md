**Data Management Checklist**
============================

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Are data management requirements clearly defined and documented?
* Are data management requirements aligned with the AI/ML project objectives?
* Is the scope of data management activities identified?

### Data Collection

* Are data collection processes specified for each data set used in the learning phase (e.g., training, validation, test)?
* Are data sources and formats defined for each data set?
* Are data collection processes validated to ensure data accuracy and completeness?

### Data Labelling (only applicable for supervised learning)

* Is labelling done correctly and consistently for all data points in the labelled data set?
* Are labelling rules and guidelines documented?
* Is there a process to verify the accuracy of labelling?

### Data Preparation (pre-processing, transformation, feature engineering)

* Are data preparation activities specified for each data set used in the learning phase?
* Are data preparation steps validated to ensure data accuracy and completeness?
* Are unwanted biases identified and eliminated from the data sets?

### Data Set Verification

* Are data sets verified for accuracy, completeness, and representativeness with respect to ML requirements and AI/ML ODD?
* Is independence between data sets ensured?
* Are data sets tested for conformance to ML requirements?
