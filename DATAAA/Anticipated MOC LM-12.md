Here is the checklist generated for the author and reviewer:

**Identity and Purpose**

### Author's Checklist

* Have I specified margins on performance metrics?
	+ Yes/No
* Have I translated performance metrics with associated margins into a probability of occurrence of the ML model failure mode?
	+ Yes/No
* Has post-processing modified the latter failure probabilities?
	+ Yes/No
* Have I studied elevated values of error metrics for the model on training/validation/testing data sets?
	+ Yes/No
* Have I developed adequate mitigations for elevated error metric values?
	+ Yes/No

### Reviewer's Checklist

* Is the author's work relevant to the requirement and reference?
	+ Yes/No
* Are margins on performance metrics specified and reasonable?
	+ Yes/No
* Does the translation of performance metrics into failure mode probability occur correctly?
	+ Yes/No
* Has post-processing been properly applied to modify failure probabilities?
	+ Yes/No
* Are elevated error metric values studied and mitigations developed adequately?
	+ Yes/No
