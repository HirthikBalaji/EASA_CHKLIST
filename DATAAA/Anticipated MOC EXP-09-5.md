**Checklist for Developing and Reviewing AI-Machine Learning Software**
============================================================

### Anticipated MOC EXP-09-5: Data Recording and Retrieval

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Record data in a way that can be retrieved and used after an accident or incident. | ✅ |
| Capture the following minimum for AI/ML constituent requirements: <br> - Safety requirements<br> - Information security requirements<br> - Functional requirements<br> - Operational requirements (including ODD monitoring and performance monitoring)<br> - Other non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability)<br> - Interface requirements | ✅ |
| Define set of parameters pertaining to AI/ML constituent ODD, and trace them to corresponding parameters pertaining to OD when applicable. | ✅ |

### Data Management

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Identify objectives to be satisfied at the level of each individual data point and at the level of data sets used later in the project development lifecycle. | ✅ |
| Capture data management requirements. | ✅ |
| Collect, label (only in supervised learning), prepare (pre-processing, data transformation, feature engineering), and verify accuracy, completeness, and representativeness of various data sets. | ✅ |
| Identify and eliminate unwanted bias inherent to the data sets. | ✅ |

### Data Point Identification

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Capture unique identification of all requirements necessary to design and implement AI/ML constituent. | ✅ |
| Review derived requirements from a safety (support) perspective, determining which function they support so that the appropriate Failure Condition classification can be assigned. | ✅ |

### Purpose

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Define set of parameters pertaining to AI/ML constituent ODD, and trace them to corresponding parameters pertaining to OD when applicable. | ✅ |
