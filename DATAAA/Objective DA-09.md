**Validation of Derived Requirements Checklist**

### Objective DA-09: Validation of Derived Requirements and Safety Assessment

As the developer of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Machine Learning (ML) software, please ensure that:

#### 1. Review Derived Requirements from a Safety Perspective

* Have you reviewed the derived requirements to determine which safety functions they support?
* Are the failure conditions classified accordingly?

#### 2. Validate AI/ML Constituent Requirements

* Have you captured all necessary requirements for the AI/ML constituent, including:
	+ Information security (IS)
	+ Ethics-based assessment (ET)
	+ Development assurance (DA)
	+ Data management (DM)
	+ Learning management (LM)
* Are these requirements validated and compliant with relevant regulations?

#### 3. Verify Modulation of Objectives

* Have you applied the modulation criteria (AI Level and criticality) to anticipate proportionality in the objectives?
* Are the objectives modulated accordingly, considering the limited experience gained from operations on AI/ML techniques?

As the reviewer, please ensure that:

#### 1. Verify Developer's Compliance with Derived Requirements

* Has the developer reviewed and validated the derived requirements from a safety perspective?
* Are the failure conditions classified correctly?

#### 2. Review AI/ML Constituent Requirements for Completeness and Validation

* Have the developer captured all necessary requirements for the AI/ML constituent, including:
	+ Information security (IS)
	+ Ethics-based assessment (ET)
	+ Development assurance (DA)
	+ Data management (DM)
	+ Learning management (LM)
* Are these requirements validated and compliant with relevant regulations?

#### 3. Verify Modulation of Objectives

* Has the developer applied the modulation criteria (AI Level and criticality) to anticipate proportionality in the objectives?
* Is the modulation correct, considering the limited experience gained from operations on AI/ML techniques?
