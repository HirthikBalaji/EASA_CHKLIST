**Checklist for Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning Software Development and Review**

### Capture of AI/ML Constituent Requirements

#### For the Developer:

| Requirement | YES / NO |
| --- | --- |
| Capture all necessary requirements to design and implement the AI/ML constituent | |
| Identify safety requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent (e.g. performance, reliability, resilience) | |
| Identify information security requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent | |
| Identify functional requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent | |
| Identify operational requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent (including AI/ML constituent ODD monitoring and performance monitoring) | |
| Identify other non-functional requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent (e.g. scalability) | |
| Identify interface requirements | |

#### For the Reviewer:

| Requirement | YES / NO |
| --- | --- |
| Verify that all necessary requirements have been captured for the AI/ML constituent design and implementation | |
| Check if safety requirements are allocated to the AI/ML constituent (e.g. performance, reliability, resilience) | |
| Validate information security requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent | |
| Confirm functional requirements are allocated to the AI/ML constituent | |
| Verify operational requirements are allocated to the AI/ML constituent (including AI/ML constituent ODD monitoring and performance monitoring) | |
| Check if other non-functional requirements are allocated to the AI/ML constituent (e.g. scalability) | |
| Validate interface requirements | |

### Definition of AI/ML Constituent ODD Parameters

#### For the Developer:

| Requirement | YES / NO |
| --- | --- |
| Define the set of parameters pertaining to the AI/ML constituent ODD | |
| Trace AI/ML constituent ODD parameters to corresponding OD parameters when applicable | |

#### For the Reviewer:

| Requirement | YES / NO |
| --- | --- |
| Verify that the AI/ML constituent ODD parameters are defined | |
| Confirm that AI/ML constituent ODD parameters are traced back to corresponding OD parameters when applicable | |
