Here is the generated checklist in Markdown format:

**Configuration Management**
======================================================

Is the configuration management process applied to the AI/ML constituent life-cycle data? |
---------------------------|
| **Yes** | **No**

* Are all configuration items identified?
| * Is versioning used for the AI/ML constituent?
| * Is baselining used for the AI/ML constituent?
| * Is change control in place for the AI/ML constituent?
| * Is reproducibility ensured for the AI/ML constituent?
| * Are problem reports generated and tracked for the AI/ML constituent?
| * Is archiving and retrieval implemented for the AI/ML constituent data?
| * Is a retention period defined for the AI/ML constituent data?

**Quality and Process Assurance**
================================

---------------------------|
| **Yes** | **No**

* Are the life-cycle process objectives met or addressed deviations documented?
| * Are activities completed as outlined in plans (as per Objective DA-01)?
| * Is independence level required for the AI/ML constituent?

**Reuse of AI/ML Models**
========================

Is reuse of AI/ML models considered for the AI-based system? |
---------------------------|
| **Yes** | **No**

* Are open source models or COTS ML models incorporated into the design?
| * Is adaptation to OD and/or ODD required for reused ML models?
| * Are data quality issues addressed when reusing ML models?
| * Is change management in place for reused ML models?
| * Is development explainability ensured for reused ML models?
| * Is scalability considered when reusing ML models?

**Data Management**
================

Are the following activities completed for data management? |
---------------------------|
| **Yes** | **No**

* Are data management requirements captured?
| * Is data collection and preparation performed?
| * Are data sets used in the learning phase identified (training, validation, test)?
| * Are data set verifications conducted (accuracy, completeness, representativeness)?
| * Are independence requirements between data sets ensured?
| * Is unwanted bias eliminated from the data sets?
