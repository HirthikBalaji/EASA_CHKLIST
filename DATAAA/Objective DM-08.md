**Identity and Purpose Checklist**
======================================================

### Data Management (Derived Requirements)

1. **Data Management Requirements Capture**: 
	* Has the data management process been properly captured? ✅
	* Are all necessary data points identified? ✅
2. **Data Collection**: 
	* Is the data collected from a single source or multiple sources? ✅
	* Are the data collection methods documented? ✅
3. **Data Labelling (only in supervised learning)**: 
	* Is the labelling process manual or automatic? ✅
	* Are the labels accurate and consistent? ✅
4. **Data Preparation (pre-processing, data transformation, feature engineering)**: 
	* Has the data been pre-processed for quality and consistency? ✅
	* Are the features engineered to improve model performance? ✅
5. **Identification of Data Sets**: 
	* Have all necessary data sets (training, validation, test) been identified? ✅
	* Are the data sets properly separated and stored? ✅
6. **Data Set Verification**: 
	* Has the accuracy, completeness, and representativeness of each data set been verified? ✅
	* Are the data sets free from unwanted bias? ✅
7. **Independence Requirements between Data Sets**: 
	* Have independence requirements between data sets been met? ✅
	* Are there any dependencies or correlations between data sets that need to be addressed? ✅

### AI/ML Constituent ODD Definition

1. **Nominal Data**: 
	* Has nominal data been properly defined for each data set? ✅
	* Are the nominal values consistent across all data sets? ✅
2. **Edge Cases, Corner Cases, and Infeasible Corner Cases Data**: 
	* Have edge cases, corner cases, and infeasible corner cases data been identified and addressed? ✅
	* Are these cases properly represented in the training data? ✅
3. **Detection and Removal of Inliers**: 
	* Has the model been trained to detect and remove inliers? ✅
	* Are there any inliers present in the test data that need to be addressed? ✅
4. **Detection and Management of Novelties**: 
	* Has the model been trained to detect novelties? ✅
	* Are there any novelties present in the test data that need to be addressed? ✅

### DQRs (Data Quality Requirements)

1. **Data Relevance**: 
	* Is the data relevant to support the intended use? ✅
2. **Data Origin**: 
	* Can the origin of the data be determined? ✅
3. **Annotation Process**: 
	* Are the annotation process requirements met? ✅
4. **Format, Accuracy, and Resolution of Data**: 
	* Is the format, accuracy, and resolution of the data properly defined? ✅
5. **Traceability of Data**: 
	* Can the data be traced back to its origin throughout the pipeline? ✅
6. **Data Integrity**: 
	* Has the data been corrupted during storage, processing, or transmission? ✅
7. **Completeness and Representativeness of Data Sets**: 
	* Are the data sets complete and representative of the intended use? ✅
