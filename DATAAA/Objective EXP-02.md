Here is the checklist for the author developing the artificial intelligence-machine learning software and for the reviewer reviewing it:

**Data Management Checklist**
============================

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Did you capture the objectives to be satisfied at the level of each individual data point?
* Are the data management requirements clear and well-defined?

### Data Collection

* Is the data collection process properly documented?
* Was the data collected from a reliable source?
* Are there any missing or incomplete data points?

### Data Labelling (only for supervised learning)

* Were the data labels accurately assigned?
* Are the labels consistent throughout the dataset?
* Are there any ambiguous or unclear labels?

### Data Preparation (pre-processing, data transformation, feature engineering)

* Did you perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps?
* Was data transformed to meet the requirements of the ML algorithm?
* Were relevant features engineered for the ML model?

### Identification of Data Sets

* Are there distinct datasets for training, validation, and testing purposes?
* Is each dataset properly identified and documented?
* Are the datasets consistent in terms of data quality and format?

### Dataset Verification (accuracy, completeness, representativeness)

* Did you verify the accuracy of the datasets?
* Are the datasets complete with no missing or incomplete data points?
* Are the datasets representative of the target population or problem domain?

### Independence Requirements between Data Sets

* Are there any requirements for independence between the datasets?
* Were these requirements met during data collection and processing?

### Identification and Elimination of Unwanted Bias

* Did you identify potential biases in the datasets?
* Were steps taken to eliminate or mitigate these biases?

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
