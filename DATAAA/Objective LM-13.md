**Identity and Purpose Checklist**
====================================

For the Author:
-------------

* Has defined the AI/ML constituent ODD (6.4.1)?
	+ Yes / No
* Have perturbations in the development phase been considered (e.g. replacement of data points, additive noise or labelling errors)? 
	+ Yes / No
* Are there other potential sources of instability considered (e.g. random initialization of the model, optimization methods or hyperparameter tuning)?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the trained model stability being verified throughout the ML constituent ODD?
	+ Yes / No
* Have nominal cases, singular points, edge and corner cases been considered for verification? 
	+ Yes / No

For the Reviewer:
--------------

	+ Yes / No
* Are perturbations in the development phase being addressed?
	+ Yes / No
* Is consideration given to other potential sources of instability?
	+ Yes / No
* Does the verification of trained model stability cover the whole AI/ML constituent ODD? 
	+ Yes / No
* Are nominal cases, singular points, edge and corner cases considered for verification? 
	+ Yes / No

**Robustness Checklist**
=====================

For the Author:
-------------

* Is the trained model robustness being verified in adverse conditions?
	+ Yes / No
* Have test cases including singular points and edge or corner cases been developed within the ODD (e.g. weather conditions like snow, fog for computer vision)?
	+ Yes / No

For the Reviewer:
--------------

* Is the trained model robustness being verified in adverse conditions?
	+ Yes / No
