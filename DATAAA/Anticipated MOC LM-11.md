	+ Have you provided quantifiable generalisation bounds? [YES/NO]
* **Model Optimisation**
	+ Have you documented any model optimisation that may affect the model behavior (e.g. pruning, quantization) and assessed their impact on the model behavior or performance? [YES/NO]

### Assurance Level 3 (DAL C)

* **Bias-Variance Trade-off**
	+ Have you accounted for bias-variance trade-off in the model family selection? [YES/NO]
	+ Has evidence of reproducibility of the model training process been provided? [YES/NO]
* **Model Verification**
	+ Have you performed an evaluation of the performance of the trained model based on test data set and documented the result of the model verification? [YES/NO]
	+ Have you performed requirements-based verification of the trained model behavior? [YES/NO]

### Assurance Level 4 (DAL D)

* **Stability Analysis**
	+ Has an analysis been performed on the stability of learning algorithms? [YES/NO]
	+ Has the verification of the stability of the trained model covering the whole AI/ML constituent ODD been performed and documented? [YES/NO]
