**EASA AI/ML Application Checklist**
=====================================

### Developer's Checklist

#### Level 1 and 2 Machine Learning Applications

* Is the application using only unsupervised learning (UL) or supervised learning (SL) techniques? [Y/N]
* Are AI/ML constituents included in the application, excluding IDAL A or B/SWAL 1 or 2/AL 1, 2, or 3 items? [Y/N]
* Has no assurance level reduction been performed for items within AI/ML constituents? [Y/N]

#### Data-Driven AI Approaches

* Is the learning strategy supervised (SL), unsupervised (UL), or reinforcement (RL)? [Y/N]
* Is a labelled data set available for supervised learning (SL) applications? [Y/N]
* Is the available data set not labelled for unsupervised learning (UL) applications? [Y/N]

#### Trustworthiness Analysis

* Has the trustworthiness analysis been performed in its full spectrum for any application? [Y/N]
