Here is the generated checklist in Markdown format:

**IDENTITY AND PURPOSE**
======================

### LM-14: Verify Anticipated Generalisation Bounds

* Has the applicant verified the anticipated generalisation bounds using the test data set?
* Are the results recorded as evidence of the validity of the anticipated generalisation bounds?

### LM-15: Capture ML Model Description

* Has the applicant captured a final ML model description in preparation for the ML model implementation step?

**MODEL IMPLEMENTATION**
=====================

### IMP-01: Requirements Capture and Validation

* Have the requirements pertaining to the ML model implementation process been captured?
* Are the AI/ML constituents' requirements, learning requirements, and data processing requirements included?

**CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT**
========================

### CM-01: Apply Configuration Management Principles

* Is all configuration management life-cycle data applied, including:
	+ Identification of configuration items
	+ Versioning
	+ Baselining
	+ Change control
	+ Reproducibility
	+ Problem reporting
	+ Archiving and retrieval
	+ Retention period?
* Are the collected data, training, validation, and test data sets used for the frozen model managed as configuration items?

**QUALITY AND PROCESS ASSURANCE**
=============================

### QA-01: Ensure Quality/Process Assurance

* Have quality/process assurance principles been applied to the development of the AI-based system with the required independence level?
* Are any deviations from plans addressed?

**REUSE OF AI/ML MODELS**
=====================

### RMM-01: Reuse Considerations

* Has consideration been given to replacing or modifying a previously developed AI/ML constituent or ML model?
* Have concerns about OD and/or ODD adaptation, data quality, change management, development explainability, and scalability been addressed?
