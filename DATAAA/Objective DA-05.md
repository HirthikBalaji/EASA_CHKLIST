Here is the checklist for the author developing the Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning software and the reviewer reviewing it:

**DQRs (Data Quality Requirements) Checklist**
=============================================

### Training Data Set

* Is the training data set relevant to support the intended use of the AI/ML software? (yes/no)
* Can the origin of the training data be determined? (yes/no)
* Are there requirements related to the annotation process for the training data? (yes/no)
* What is the format, accuracy, and resolution of the training data? ( specify )
* Is the training data set complete and representative? (yes/no)
* Are the training, validation, and test data sets independent? (yes/no)

### Data Accuracy

* What is the accuracy of the training data? ( specify )
* What is the resolution of the training data? ( specify )

### Annotated Data Quality

* What is the quality of the annotated training data? (good, fair, poor)
* Are there any necessary manipulations of the training data (e.g. anonymization)? (yes/no)

### Integrity and Corruption Prevention

* Has the training data been corrupted while stored, processed, or transmitted over a communication network? (yes/no)
* Are there mechanisms in place to prevent corruption of the training data? (yes/no)

### Data Representativeness

* Is the training data representative of the intended use case? (yes/no)
* Are there any biases or anomalies present in the training data? (yes/no)

**Reviewer's Checklist**
========================

* Have all DQRs been met for the training, validation, and test data sets? (yes/no)
* Is the data quality sufficient to support the intended use of the AI/ML software? (yes/no)
* Are there any gaps or inconsistencies in the data that could affect the performance of the AI/ML software? (yes/no)

Note: This checklist is a deep dive into the requirements for Data Quality Requirements (DQRs) and is intended to be used by both the author developing the AI/ML software and the reviewer reviewing it.
