	+ Has the applicant defined the nominal data for the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Identify edge cases, corner cases**: YES/NO
	+ Have the applicant identified edge cases, corner cases in preparation of stability of the model?
* **Define infeasible corner cases data**: YES/NO
	+ Has the applicant defined infeasible corner cases data for the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Detect and remove inliers**: YES/NO
	+ Have the applicant detected and removed inliers from the data set?
* **Detect and manage novelties**: YES/NO
	+ Have the applicant detected and managed novelties in the data set?
* **Define outliers for detection and management**: YES/NO
	+ Has the applicant defined outliers for their detection and management?

### Reviewer Checklist

* **Capture DQRs for all data**: YES/NO
	+ Are the Data Quality Requirements (DQRs) captured for all data required for training, testing, and verification of the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Data relevance to support intended use**: YES/NO
	+ Does the data support the intended use of the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Ability to determine origin of data**: YES/NO
	+ Is it possible to determine the origin of the data for the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Requirements related to annotation process**: YES/NO
	+ Are the requirements related to the annotation process satisfied for the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Format, accuracy, and resolution of data**: YES/NO
	+ Is the format, accuracy, and resolution of the data suitable for the AI/ML constituent ODD?
* **Traceability of data from origin to final operation**: YES/NO
	+ Can the data be traced back from its origin to its final operation through the whole pipeline of operations?

Note: This checklist is based on the requirements outlined in the EASA Concept Paper: guidance for Level 1 & 2 machine learning applications.
