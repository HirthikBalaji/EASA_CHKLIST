Here is the checklist generated for the author developing the artificial intelligence-machine learning software and for the reviewer reviewing it:

**IDENTITY AND PURPOSE**

### Checklist for Author:

* Is the AI-based system designed to be openly available? [YES/NO]
* Are traceability and logging mechanisms included from the early design phase of the AI-based system? [YES/NO]
* Does the system have authority to make decisions without approval from another member involved in operations? [YES/NO]
* Is automation used to reduce human input for repetitive tasks? [YES/NO]
* Does the system exhibit autonomy by modifying its intended domain of use or goal without external intervention? [YES/NO]
* Are advanced automation features used under specified conditions? [YES/NO]

**BIAS**

### Checklist for Author:

* Has data bias been considered in the ML model? [YES/NO]
* Is high bias present, causing the learning algorithm to miss relevant relations between attributes and target outputs? [YES/NO]
* Are measures taken to eliminate unwanted bias inherent to the data sets? [YES/NO]

**DATA MANAGEMENT**

### Checklist for Author:

* Has data management requirements capture been done? [YES/NO]
* Is data collection thorough and accurate? [YES/NO]
* Have data sets been labelled correctly (only in supervised learning)? [YES/NO]
* Are data preparation activities (pre-processing, data transformation, feature engineering) complete? [YES/NO]
* Have the various data sets used in the learning phase (training, validation, test) been identified and verified? [YES/NO]
* Are data sets independent of each other? [YES/NO]
* Has unwanted bias inherent to the data sets been eliminated? [YES/NO]
