Here is the generated checklist:

**For Developer:**
### Supervised Learning

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the available data set labelled? | |
| Has a cost function been defined to measure the difference between ML model output and expected output (labels)? | |
| Are parameters adjusted to increase accuracy of ML model? | |
| Is the learning algorithm processing input data set correctly? | |

### Unsupervised Learning

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the available data set not labelled? | |
| Has a cost function been defined to indicate whether ML model has converged to a stable solution? | |
| Are parameters adjusted to increase accuracy of ML model? | |
| Is the learning algorithm processing input data set correctly? | |

### Reinforcement Learning

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is there an environment available for agent(s) to 'practice' in? | |
| Are agents rewarded positively or negatively based on effect of actions on environment? | |
| Are ML model parameters updated from trial-and-error sequence to optimize outcome? | |
| Is the learning algorithm processing input data set correctly? | |

**For Reviewer:**
### Supervised Learning

| Requirement | Yes/No |
