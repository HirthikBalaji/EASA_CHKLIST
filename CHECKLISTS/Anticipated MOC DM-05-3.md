Here is the checklist for the author and reviewer:

**AI/ML Constituent ODD Requirements Checklist**
=====================================================

### Confirming the AI/ML Constituent ODD Definition

* Is the AI/ML constituent ODD defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are the parameters in the AI/ML constituent ODD relevant to support the intended use?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Can the origin of the data be determined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are requirements related to the annotation process defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the format, accuracy, and resolution of the data defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the traceability of the data from its origin to its final operation through the whole pipeline of operations ensured?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are mechanisms ensuring that the data will not be corrupted while stored, processed, or transmitted over a communication network defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the completeness and representativeness of the data sets defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are the levels of independence between the training, validation, and test data sets defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]

### Data Quality Requirements

* Is the accuracy of each type of data representing an operating parameter of the AI/ML constituent ODD defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the resolution of each type of data representing an operating parameter of the AI/ML constituent ODD defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the quality of annotated data for each type of data representing an operating parameter of the AI/ML constituent ODD defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is the integrity of each type of data representing an operating parameter of the AI/ML constituent ODD ensured, i.e., it has not been corrupted while stored, processed, or transmitted over a communication network?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are necessary manipulations of the data (e.g. anonymization) defined for each type of data representing an operating parameter of the AI/ML constituent ODD?
	+ [Yes] / [No]

### Additional Parameters and Operating Conditions

* Are additional parameters linked to sensors used for input data of the ML model (e.g. brightness, contrast, level of blur) identified and defined?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Is a semantic approach required for defining operating parameters in high-dimensional use cases (e.g. computer vision)?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are ranges for parameters in the AI/ML constituent ODD limited to an area of the OD where ML model performance is aligned with captured requirements?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
* Are exceptionally, one or a few ranges for parameters in the AI/ML constituent ODD supersets of ranges for corresponding parameters at the level of the OD?
	+ [Yes] / [No]
