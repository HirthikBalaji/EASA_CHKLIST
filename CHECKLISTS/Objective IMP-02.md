**Identity and Purpose Checklist**

**Data Management (DM)**

1. **Validation and Verification**
	* Is the data validation performed throughout the data management process?
	* Are the data management requirements addressed? [Yes/No]
2. **Data Verification**
	* Is a data verification step performed to confirm the appropriateness of the defined ODD and data sets used for training, validation, and verification of the ML model?
	* Are the data sets verified for accuracy, completeness, and representativeness with respect to the ML requirements and AI/ML constituent ODD? [Yes/No]

**Learning Management (LM)**

1. **Model Architecture**
	* Is the ML model architecture described?
	* Is the model family selection justified?
	* Are the learning algorithm(s) selected and justified? [Yes/No]
2. **Training Process Requirements**
	* Are the requirements for model bias and variance metrics and acceptable levels documented?
	* Are the requirements for model robustness and stability metrics and acceptable levels documented?
	* Is the training environment (hardware and software) identified?
	* Are the hyper-parameters identified and set?
	* Are the expected performance metrics with training, validation, and test sets documented? [Yes/No]
3. **Model Training**
	* Is the result of the model training documented?
	* Are any model optimisation strategies (e.g., pruning, quantization) documented and justified? [Yes/No]
4. **Generalisation Bounds**
	* Are quantifiable generalisation bounds provided? [Yes/No]

**Evaluation and Verification**

1. **Model Evaluation**
	* Is the performance of the trained model evaluated based on the test data set?
	* Are the results of the model evaluation documented?
2. **Requirements-Based Verification**
	* Is a requirements-based verification of the trained model behavior performed?
3. **Stability Analysis**
	* Is an analysis on the stability of the learning algorithms performed? [Yes/No]
4. **Model Stability Verification**
	* Is the verification of the stability of the trained model documented, covering the whole AI/ML constituent ODD?

**Data Management (DM) and Learning Management (LM) Integration**

1. **Data Set Independence**
	* Are the data sets verified for independence requirements between them?
2. **Unwanted Bias Elimination**
	* Is unwanted bias inherent to the data sets identified and eliminated? [Yes/No]
