* Are other non-functional requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent (e.g. scalability)? **[YES/NO]**
* Are interface requirements defined? **[YES/NO]**

### AI/ML Constituent ODD Characterization

### Inference Model Verification

* Has an evaluation of the performance of the inference model based on test data been performed? **[YES/NO]**
* Are the results of the model verification documented? **[YES/NO]**
* Is the final performance with the test data set measured and fed back to the safety assessment process? **[YES/NO]**

### Inference Model Stability Verification

* Has verification of the stability of the inference model been performed? **[YES/NO]**
