Here is the checklist for the author developing the artificial intelligent - machine learning software and for the reviewer reviewing it:

**Validation of Requirements**

### Objective DA-07: Validate AI/ML Constituent Architecture Development

* Has each requirement captured under Objectives DA-02, DA-03, DA-04, DA-05 been validated?
	+ Yes / No
* Are the architecture components traced back to the corresponding parameters in the OD (Objective CO-04)?
	+ Yes / No
* Have all derived requirements been reviewed from a safety perspective and assigned a Failure Condition classification?
	+ Yes / No

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Has data management requirements capture been performed for each individual data point and data sets used during the W-shaped process?
	+ Yes / No
* Are the various data sets (training, validation, test) identified and verified for accuracy, completeness, and representativeness with respect to the ML requirements and AI/ML constituent ODD?
	+ Yes / No
* Have independence requirements between data sets been ensured and unwanted bias eliminated?
	+ Yes / No

### Safety Perspective Review

* Have all derived requirements been reviewed from a safety perspective to determine which function they support, so that the appropriate Failure Condition classification can be assigned?
	+ Yes / No
