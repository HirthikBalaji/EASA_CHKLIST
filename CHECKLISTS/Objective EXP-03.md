* Are the requirements complete and free from ambiguities?
	+ YES / NO
* Has a traditional flow-down of requirements been performed (e.g., from aircraft to system)?
	+ YES / NO
* Have feature engineering and data labeling tasks been automated or made more efficient?
	+ YES / NO

### PROPORTIONALITY OF GUIDANCE

* Have the AI Level and criticality of the item containing the ML model been assessed?
	+ YES / NO
* Are the objectives modulated based on the AI Level and criticality?
	+ YES / NO

	+ YES / NO

### LEARNING ASSURANCE PROCESS PLANNING

* Has a plan for learning assurance (e.g., plan for learning aspects of certification) been developed?
	+ YES / NO
* Are all objectives from Section C.3 addressed in the plan?
	+ YES / NO
* Is the interface and compatibility with development assurance processes ensured?
	+ YES / NO

### MLOPS PRACTICES
