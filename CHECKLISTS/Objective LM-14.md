Here is the generated checklist for the author developing the artificial intelligent-machine learning software and for the reviewer reviewing it:

**Data Management**
### Data Management Requirements Capture

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the data management process clearly defined? | |
| Are the objectives to be satisfied at each individual data point identified? | |
| Are the data sets used in the project development lifecycle identified? | |
| Are the various data set types (e.g. training, validation, test) distinguished? | |

### Data Collection

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the source of each data set clearly identified? | |
| Are data quality issues addressed? | |
| Are data inconsistencies or errors handled? | |
| Are data sets verified for accuracy and completeness? | |

### Data Labelling (only in supervised learning)

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the labelling process consistent across all data sets? | |
| Are labels accurate and reliable? | |
| Are data sets labelled according to the ML requirements? | |

### Data Preparation (pre-processing, data transformation, feature engineering)

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Are data sets pre-processed for quality and consistency? | |
| Are features engineered or transformed as needed? | |
| Is data prepared for use in the ML model? | |

### Data Set Verification

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is each data set verified for accuracy, completeness, and representativeness? | |
| Are data sets checked against the ML requirements? | |
| Are data sets verified with respect to the AI/ML constituent ODD? | |

### Independence Requirements between Data Sets

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Are data sets independent of each other? | |
| Is there no correlation or bias between data sets? | |
| Are data sets checked for unwanted bias? | |

This checklist is designed to help the author and reviewer ensure that the artificial intelligent-machine learning software development meets the requirements outlined in the EASA Concept Paper: Guidance for Level 1 & 2 machine learning applications.
