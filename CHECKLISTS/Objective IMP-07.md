Here is the checklist generated based on the requirements:

**Requirements Capture Checklist**
### AI/ML Constituent Requirements

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Capture and unique identification of all requirements necessary to design and implement the AI/ML constituent | |
| Allocate safety requirements (e.g. performance, reliability, resilience) | |
| Allocate information security requirements | |
| Allocate functional requirements | |
| Allocate operational requirements (including ODD monitoring and performance monitoring) | |
| Allocate other non-functional requirements (e.g. scalability) | |
| Define interface requirements | |

### AI/ML Constituent ODD Characterization

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Define the set of parameters pertaining to the AI/ML constituent ODD | |
| Trace parameters to corresponding parameters in the OD when applicable | |

### Validation Checklist (for Reviewer)

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Verify that all AI/ML constituent requirements are captured and identified | |
| Confirm that safety, information security, functional, operational, and non-functional requirements are allocated | |
| Validate ODD characterization parameters are defined and traced to OD parameters when applicable | |

Note: This checklist is a low-level output, breaking down the high-level requirements into more specific and granular checks. The reviewer can use this checklist to validate that the AI/ML constituent requirements have been properly captured and met.
