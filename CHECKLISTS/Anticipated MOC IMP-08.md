Here is the checklist generated based on the requirements:

**Data Management Checklist**

### Data Management Requirements Capture

* Has the data management process identified objectives to be satisfied at the level of each individual data point?
	+ Yes / No
* Have data collection, labelling (only in supervised learning), and preparation (pre-processing, data transformation, and feature engineering) been considered?
	+ Yes / No
* Are the various datasets used in the learning phase (training, validation, and test datasets) identified?
	+ Yes / No

### Data Collection

* Has data been collected from multiple sources?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the quality of the collected data ensured?
	+ Yes / No
* Have data inconsistencies and errors been addressed?
	+ Yes / No

### Data Labelling (only in supervised learning)

* Are labels accurate and consistent?
	+ Yes / No
* Has data labelling been conducted by multiple annotators to ensure consistency?
	+ Yes / No

### Data Preparation (pre-processing, data transformation, and feature engineering)

* Have data preprocessing techniques (e.g., normalization, scaling) been applied?
	+ Yes / No
* Are features engineered to improve model performance?
	+ Yes / No
* Has data transformation been conducted to handle missing values or outliers?
	+ Yes / No

### Data Set Verification

* Is the accuracy of the training, validation, and test datasets verified?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the completeness of the datasets ensured?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the representativeness of the datasets with respect to the ML requirements and AI/ML constituent ODD verified?
	+ Yes / No

### Independence Requirements between Data Sets

* Are the various datasets used in the learning phase independent of each other?
	+ Yes / No
* Have steps been taken to ensure data independence (e.g., anonymization, encryption)?
	+ Yes / No

### Identification and Elimination of Unwanted Bias

* Has unwanted bias inherent to the datasets been identified?
	+ Yes / No
* Have steps been taken to eliminate or mitigate bias (e.g., data preprocessing, feature engineering)?
	+ Yes / No
