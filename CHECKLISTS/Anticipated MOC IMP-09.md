Here is the generated checklist:

**Identity and Purpose**
### LM-07 to LM-12: Model Development and Verification

#### LM-07: Bias-Variance Trade-off
* Have you accounted for bias-variance trade-off in model family selection?
* Is there evidence of reproducibility of the model training process?

#### LM-08: Model Performance Evaluation
* Are the estimated bias and variance of the selected model meeting the associated learning process management requirements?
* Has the trained model been evaluated based on test data set?

#### LM-09: Model Verification
* Has a verification of the trained model behavior been performed?
* Are the results documented?

#### LM-10: Requirements-Based Verification
* Has a requirements-based verification of the trained model behavior been performed?
* Are the results documented?

#### LM-11: Stability Analysis
* Has an analysis on the stability of the learning algorithms been performed?
* Are the results documented?

#### LM-12: Model Stability Verification
* Has a verification of the stability of the trained model been performed, covering the whole AI/ML constituent ODD?
* Are the results documented?

**Inference Model Verification and Integration**
### LM-06 to LM-07: Inference Model Properties Preservation

#### LM-06: Inference Model Properties Preservation
* Have you verified that any transformation (conversion, optimization, inference model development) performed during the trained model implementation step has not adversely altered the defined model properties?
* Are the results documented?

**Platform Verification**
### LM-07: Platform Differences Assessment

#### LM-07: Platform Differences Assessment
* Have you identified and assessed the differences between the software and hardware of the platform used for model training and those used for inference model verification?
* Are the possible impacts on inference model behavior and performance documented?
