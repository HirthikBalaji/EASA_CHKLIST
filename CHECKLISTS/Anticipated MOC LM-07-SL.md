Here is the generated checklist:

**Data Allocation Checklist**
==========================

### Data Set Separation

* Are three separate data sets created: training, validation, and test?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the test data set independent from the other two data sets?
	+ Yes / No
* Are the data sets complete and representative of the population?
	+ Yes / No

### Model Family Selection

* Has bias-variance trade-off been considered in model family selection?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the complexity of the selected model family high enough to minimize bias, but not too high to avoid high variance?
	+ Yes / No
* Are methods used to provide estimates of the bias and variance of the selected model family (e.g. holdout data, k-fold sampling)?
	+ Yes / No

### Learning Process Verification

* Has the trained model been evaluated using the test data set?
	+ Yes / No
* Is the performance of the trained model documented?
	+ Yes / No
* Have systematic errors in the training data set been identified and mitigated?
	+ Yes / No
