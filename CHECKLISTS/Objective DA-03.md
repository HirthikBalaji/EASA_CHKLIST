Here is the checklist in human-readable Markdown format:

**Definition of AI/ML Constituent ODD Parameters**
=============================================

### Has the applicant captured the parameters pertaining to the AI/ML constituent ODD?

* Yes | No
### Are the additional parameters for the AI/ML constituent ODD identified and defined? (e.g. sensor characteristics, level of blur)

* Yes | No
### Are some operating parameters defined with a semantic approach for high-dimensional use cases?

* Yes | No

**Definition of Nominal Data**
=============================

### Is nominal data defined for the AI/ML constituent ODD?

* Yes | No
### Are edge cases and corner cases identified and considered in preparing the model?

* Yes | No
### Are infeasible corner cases and outliers detected and managed?

* Yes | No

**Data Quality Requirements (DQRs)**
=====================================

### Have DQRs been captured for all data required for training, testing, and verification of the AI/ML constituent?

* Yes | No
### Do the DQRs include requirements related to:
	+ Data relevance and origin
	+ Annotation process
	+ Format, accuracy, and resolution of the data
	+ Traceability of the data from origin to final operation
	+ Mechanisms for ensuring data integrity during storage, processing, or transmission

* Yes | No
### Are the completeness and representativeness of the data sets considered?

* Yes | No
### Is there a level of independence between training, validation, and test data sets?

* Yes | No
