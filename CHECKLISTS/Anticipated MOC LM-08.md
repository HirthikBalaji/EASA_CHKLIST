**Checklist for AI/ML Software Development and Review**

**Identity and Purpose**
=====================

### 1. Model Training

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Has the model been trained using a suitable algorithm? |  |
| Is the training data set representative of the real-world scenario? |  |
| Are there any biases or systematic errors in the training data? |  |

### 2. Regularization

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Has regularization been applied to avoid overfitting? |  |
| Is the amount of regularization suitable for the model complexity? |  |

### 3. Model Verification

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Has the trained model been verified using a test data set? |  |
| Are there any significant biases or systematic errors in the model performance? |  |

**Configuration Management**
=====================

### 1. Configuration Item Management

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Are all configuration items identified, tracked, and controlled? |  |
| Is versioning and baselining being used for changes to the AI/ML constituent? |  |

### 2. Change Control and Problem Reporting

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Are changes to the AI/ML constituent being properly controlled and documented? |  |
| Are problem reports being generated and tracked for issues with the AI/ML constituent? |  |

**Quality and Process Assurance**
=====================

### 1. Quality Control

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Is quality control being applied to ensure that the AI/ML constituent meets requirements? |  |
| Are deviations from plans being addressed and documented? |  |

**Reuse of AI/ML Models**
=====================

### 1. Model Adaptation

| Requirement | Yes / No |
| --- | --- |
| Has the reused ML model been adapted to meet the specific requirements of the new application? |  |
| Are there any issues with data quality or scalability in the reused ML model? |  |
