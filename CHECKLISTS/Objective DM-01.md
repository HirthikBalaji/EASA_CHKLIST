Here is the generated checklist in Markdown format:

**Data Management Checklist**

* Did you capture data management requirements? ⬜️
	+ Is the objective to manage data and deliver data sets for the W-shaped process?
	+ Are the individual data point objectives identified, as well as those for the data sets used later in the project lifecycle?
* Have you collected the necessary data? ⬜️
	+ Is the data relevant to the AI/ML application?
	+ Are there any missing or irrelevant data points?
* Has the data been labelled (only for supervised learning)? ⬜️
	+ Is the labelling accurate and consistent?
	+ Are there any errors or inconsistencies in the labelling process?
* Have you prepared the data (pre-processing, transformation, feature engineering)? ⬜️
	+ Are the data sets clean and free of errors?
	+ Are there any unnecessary features or variables that can be removed?
* Have you identified the various data sets used in the learning phase? ⬜️
	+ Are the training, validation, and test data sets clearly defined?
	+ Are there any duplicate or redundant data sets?
* Has the data been verified (accuracy, completeness, representativeness)? ⬜️
	+ Is the data accurate and consistent with the ML requirements?
	+ Are there any errors or inconsistencies in the verification process?
* Are the data sets independent? ⬜️
	+ Are there any correlations or dependencies between the data sets?
	+ Can the data sets be used separately without affecting each other?
* Has unwanted bias been identified and eliminated from the data sets? ⬜️
	+ Is the data representative of the target population or scenario?
	+ Are there any biases or unfair advantages in the data that need to be addressed?
