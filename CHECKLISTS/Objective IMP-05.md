**Author Checklist for Developing Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning Software**

### Trustworthiness Analysis

1. Is trustworthiness analysis performed in its full spectrum?
2. Are the AI/ML constituents free from IDAL A, B/SWAL 1 or 2/AL 1, 2 or 3 items?

### Supervised Learning

1. Is a labelled data set available for learning?
2. Is a cost function used to measure the difference between the ML model output and expected output (labels in the data sets)?
3. Are parameters adjusted to increase the accuracy of the ML model?

### Unsupervised Learning

1. Is the available data set not labelled?
2. Is a cost function used to indicate whether the ML model has converged to a stable solution?
3. Are parameters adjusted to increase the accuracy of the ML model?

### Reinforcement Learning

1. Is an environment available for the agent(s) to "practice" in?
2. Is the agent(s) rewarded positively or negatively based on the effect of actions on the environment?
3. Are ML model parameters updated from trial-and-error sequence to optimize the outcome?
