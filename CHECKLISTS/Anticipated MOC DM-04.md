Here is the checklist in human-readable Markdown format:

**Identity and Purpose**
======================

### DA-09: Validation of Derived Requirements

* Have you documented evidence of the validation of derived requirements?
* Has any impact on safety/support assessment been determined?
* Are system requirements affected by AI/ML constituent?

### DA-10: Verification of (Sub)System Requirements

* Have all captured (sub)system requirements allocated to the AI/ML constituent been verified?

**Data Management**
=================

### DM-01: Data Collection and Definition of ODD

* Have data sources been identified?
* Has data been collected in accordance with the defined ODD?
* Are DQRs satisfied for training, validation, and test data sets?

### DM-02-SL: Annotated or Labelled Data Satisfies DQRs

* Is annotated or labelled data in the data set satisfying the DQRs captured under Objective DA-04?

### DM-02-UL: Test Data Set Labeled and Satisfying DQRs

* Has test data set been labelled?
* Does the annotated or labelled data in this test data set satisfy the DQRs captured under Objective DA-04?

### DM-03: Data Preparation Operations

* Have data preparation operations been defined to properly address requirements (including DQRs)?

### DM-04: Pre-processing Operations on Collected Data

* Have pre-processing operations on collected data been defined and documented?

### DM-05: Transformations to Pre-processed Data

* Have transformations to pre-processed data from specified input space into features been defined and documented?

### DM-06: Distribution of Data into Separate Sets

* Has data been distributed into three separate sets meeting the specified DQRs in terms of independence (as per Objective DA-04)?

**Configuration Management**
========================

### CM-01: Application of Configuration Management Principles

* Have configuration management principles been applied to AI/ML constituent life-cycle data?
* Are configuration items identified, versioned, baselined, and controlled?
* Is problem reporting, archiving, and retrieval, and retention period in place?

**Quality and Process Assurance**
==============================

### QA-01: Application of Quality/Process Assurance Principles

* Have quality/process assurance principles been applied to the development of AI-based system with required independence level?
