**Checklist for AI-Machine Learning Software Development and Review**

### Data Preparation and Normalization

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Has the data been collected, processed, and cleaned? | |
| Are there any missing or irrelevant values in the data? | |
| Have outliers been managed in the data? | |
| Is the data normalized (if necessary) to ensure fairness and accuracy? | |
| Is the mean and standard deviation of candidate features calculated for normalization? | |

### Data Allocation

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Are there three separate data sets: training, validation, and test? | |
| Are these data sets independent and representative of the entire dataset? | |
| Is the test data set used only during inference model verification? | |
| Are the training and validation data sets used during model training? | |

### Machine Learning Techniques

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Is the machine learning technique supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning? | |
| Is the supervised learning strategy using labeled data sets? | |
| Is the unsupervised learning strategy without labeled data sets? | |
| Is the reinforcement learning strategy using an environment and rewards/penalties? | |

### Model Training and Verification

| Requirement | Yes/No |
| --- | --- |
| Has the model been trained on the training data set? | |
| Has the model been validated on the validation data set? | |
| Has the model been tested on the test data set? | |
| Is the inference model verified using the test data set? | |
